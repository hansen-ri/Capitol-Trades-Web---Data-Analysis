# Capitol-Trades-Web---Data-Analysis

# Overview

A hybrid Python program that blends web scraping practices with data analytics. I wanted to write a program that would grab up-to-date data from [CapitolTrades.com](https://www.capitoltrades.com/trades?page=1&pageSize=25) and display pertenant information for potential personal investments.

# Data Analysis Results

* Who is doing the investing?
* What political party do they affiliate with?
* What are they investing in?

# Development Environment

Visual Studio Code
Python 3.9.5 64-bit
Python BeautifulSoup4 & Pandas libraries

# Useful Websites

* [RealPython.com](https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/)
* [YouTube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-koIYWCaIo)

# Future Work

* Implement menu options as the program begins. User should be able to pick from a list of desired end results, which entails the user knowing exactly what they're getting into from the start.
* Implement in-depth Pandas utilities that will be able to frame data as usefully as possible depending on the output that is desired by the user.
* Look into the fine-tuned process of exporting the dataframes into an Excel file so that the program will save instances of inquiries as time goes on.
